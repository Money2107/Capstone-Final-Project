    "\n",
    "Naïve Bayes is a family of simple yet powerful probabilistic classifiers based on applying Bayes’ Theorem with the “naïve” assumption of feature independence. It is widely used in text classification tasks such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization due to its speed, simplicity, and surprisingly strong performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its simplicity, Naïve Bayes often performs competitively with more complex algorithms, especially when the assumption of independence holds approximately true. It is especially effective when dealing with large feature spaces and small datasets."
